# Project-Order-Managment

A simple project order management system which tracks the entire cycle of a project by dividing it in to tasks and assign teams to each task.It maintains all information of
a project which are needed by the company and outcomes of the projects as a product.

I developed this project during my internship at <strong>Ethiopian Airlines</strong> application development department.
